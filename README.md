# React Vidly App

## Functionality

This app maps through the fakeMovieService.js file and creates rows for each movie within the Movies array. A delete button is created in each table row, that when clicked, allows the user to remove that movie from the screen. 

A message displays at the top of the screen showing the number of movies within the table, and updates as a movie is deleted. When there are no movies left within the table, a new message will display informing us of that.
